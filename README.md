# Deberts - playing card game

The project is under development. This will be a playing card game for 2-4 players. It will utilize [Cards On Table](https://github.com/alexterliuk/cards-on-table) package which is also not complete yet.

When the project is done, it will be deployed to a server with free access, so anyone will be able to start a game and invite players to join by sending them a link.

Rules of Deberts and more information will be added later. There is an article on Wikipedia about the game, but currently only in [Ukrainian](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%86) and [Russian](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%86) languages.
